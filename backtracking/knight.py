#Given a N*N board with the Knight placed on the first block of an empty board. Moving according to the rules of chess knight must visit 
# each square exactly once. Print the order of each cell in which they are visited.

# Naive Algorithm for Knight’s tour 
# The Naive Algorithm is to generate all tours one by one and check if the generated tour satisfies the constraints. 

# while there are untried tours
# { 
#    generate the next tour 
#    if this tour covers all squares 
#    { 
#       print this path;
